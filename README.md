# Embedded-System
Processors have advanced well beyond the early days of 8-bit microcontrollers. Now, embedded computers are designed into multiprocessors that can run millions of lines of code. They do so in real time and at very low power levels. 
This course goal is to provide a frame of reference for the burgeoning field of high-performance embedded computing. The student learns how to design low power, low cost and High-Performance systems. The course also provides the hands-on project of Embedded High-Performance System design.
